  Java programming language was originally developed by Sun Microsystems which was
initiated by James Gosling and released in 1995 as core component of Sun Microsystems'
Java platform (Java 1.0 [J2SE]).
The latest release of the Java Standard Edition is Java SE 8. With the advancement of Java
and its widespread popularity, multiple configurations were built to suit various types of
platforms. For example: J2EE for Enterprise Applications, J2ME for Mobile Applications.
The new J2 versions were renamed as Java SE, Java EE, and Java ME respectively. Java
is guaranteed to be Write Once, Run Anywhere.
Java is:
 Object Oriented: In Java, everything is an Object. Java can be easily extended
since it is based on the Object model.
 Platform Independent: Unlike many other programming languages including C
and C++, when Java is compiled, it is not compiled into platform specific machine,
rather into platform independent byte code. This byte code is distributed over the
web and interpreted by the Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being
run on.
 Simple: Java is designed to be easy to learn. If you understand the basic concept
of OOP Java, it would be easy to master.
 Secure: With Java's secure feature it enables to develop virus-free, tamper-free
systems. Authentication techniques are based on public-key encryption.
 Architecture-neutral: Java compiler generates an architecture-neutral object
file format, which makes the compiled code executable on many processors, with
the presence of Java runtime system.
 Portable: Being architecture-neutral and having no implementation dependent
aspects of the specification makes Java portable. Compiler in Java is written in
ANSI C with a clean portability boundary, which is a POSIX subset.
 Robust: Java makes an effort to eliminate error prone situations by emphasizing
mainly on compile time error checking and runtime checking.
 Multithreaded: With Java's multithreaded feature it is possible to write programs
that can perform many tasks simultaneously. This design feature allows the
developers to construct interactive applications that can run smoothly.
 Interpreted: Java byte code is translated on the fly to native machine
instructions and is not stored anywhere. The development process is more rapid
and analytical since the linking is an incremental and light-weight process.
 High Performance: With the use of Just-In-Time compilers, Java enables high
performance.
